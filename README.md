========
A project building a smart solar powered water heater controller using Raspi, Arduino and OpenHAB2. (My parents wanted a smarter controller ï¼š-P )

Controller of The Heater
-------
# Introduction
>>The control interface build using openHAB2. The GUI is originally written in Chinese. 
* The upper part is the status of the heater 
* lower part is the settings for water level etc. 
* The GUI has built-in safes. The heater or the valve will be turned off if the status meets or exceedthe the settings regardless of if the "full-auto" is on.
